            Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
            It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.
            Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly, particularly with the help of the Compass style library.
